# M5Burner launcher application (precompiled)

## What is this?
It is used for packaging Windows builds, the official version used a simple C# app written in .NET 4.x, so this is a version which does the same thing but with added feedback functionality if the binary can't be located or if the binary throws an error during execution.
This version is what gets copied over during packaging, if you wan't custom modifications to this app and include it during packaging, compile the source version and copy it to this folder.

## How to use
1. Copy the binary to the M5Burner folder root
